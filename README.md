Project Rhythmic
__________

Yeah, I've decided that this is not a Vocaloid rhythm game, producers are very picky and can strike anybody down anytime plus I'd need permission from Crypton and Yamaha. Any song can be added upon request.

So, I decided to try write a rhythm game in Python! Yeah, sounds dumb but I did it anyways! I found this amazing OpenGL library for Python called Pyglet. I now use it as the rendering base and'll probably for the audio backend aswell as it supports OpenAL, DirectSound etc.
I tried making this in Unity but it seemed too hard to follow documentation and I'm more familiar with Python than C#, if they supported Python (which they'll probably never because Python is very unoptimal for stuff like 3D, lol.), I'd probably use Unity in that case.

Contribute today if you know Pyglet and Python aswell.
